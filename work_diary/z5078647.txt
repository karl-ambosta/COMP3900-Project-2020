Week 1

Team was formed in lab. I set up Jira and we all decided that Joel will be the lead/scrum master.
Currently learning how to use Jira properly and for purposes of project management. 
Communication is via microsoft teams and we are brainstorming ideas of what should/can be implemented for our project.

Parts for draft proposal separated. 
The following were my parts and were completed as a part of drafting the proposal: 
- gantt chart using teamgantt

My tasks in week 3 will involve editing and combining all part of the proposal. 

Week 3

Began compiling and editing final report, editing Jintao's section with Joel. 
Edited all other parts ensuring that it made sense and free of grammatical errors. 
Completed editing on Saturday morning and passed onto Joel for final checks and submission. 

Week 4

Researched about vue.js, django and auth0. Began using those to create a landing page to form an understanding of how they worked together, but had decided to use django rest framework instead. Burton created initial backend, therefore had to 
wait until it was completed.
