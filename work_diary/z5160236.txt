Week 1

- Group "Tues14" was formed and decided to use Microsfot Teams as a way of communicating ideas and storing project files. Project #6 - "Waiter" was chosen to be the project that we would work on. Started brainstorming on possible features that could be implemented into the project and how we could merged multiple projects in order to obtain a better mark. 

Week 2

- Talked about the sections that needed to be included in the Project Proposal due next week and allocated sections to group members. I was allocated the system flow diagram. As such, a system flow diagram for each different type of user was needed (Customer, Cashier, Waiter, Kitcher Staff and Management). Also added user stories for the Management user to the Jira board.

Week 3

- Fixed up the system flow diagrams to better showcase the structure and the content that will be displayed on each screen, as per our tutors feedback. Our group has chosen to use Python/Django for the back-end and Vue.js and Bootstrap for the front-end. The rest of the week has been spent practicing using Vue.js along with Python to create various different features that can be added to our webpages.

Week 4

- Started working on the landing pages for the website in HTML, before we use Django and Vue to display it. A basic skeleton has been completed during the tutorial and now the CSS/Bootstrap on the pages will be completed over the week to display more like the finish product. Aim to finish the landing page and all adjoining pages for next week's demo.

Week 5

- This week, Joel and myself decided to work together on the first type of ser screens and the customer screens were tasked to finish. After this week, we will break off and work on separate user screens to get through the fron-end faster. I have completed most of the screens that the customer will use to access when using the app. After finishing most of the screens, I have decided for next week, to work on adding Vue to the html page, as was planned for the project.
