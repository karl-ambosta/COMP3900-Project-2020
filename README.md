# Tues14 - Waiter Project

Welcome to the Tues14 team Github repository.

We aim to create a friendly, effective and easy-use application to solve theproblems restaurants are facing. For different people in the restaurant setting, it will provide different functions tailored to their needs, which will deliver a better dining experience for every person involved, not just the diner.
